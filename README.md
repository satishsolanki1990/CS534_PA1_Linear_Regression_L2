Preprocessing and simple analysis. Perform the following preprocessing of the your data.

## Part 1

   Explore different learning rate for batch gradient descent. 

## Part 2

   Experiments with dierent /lmbda values.
 
## Part 3

 Training with non-normalized data Use the preprocessed data but skip the nor- malization.
