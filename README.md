## Objective:


## Data:



## Part 0 : Exploratory Data Analysis

Preprocessing and simple analysis. Perform the following preprocessing of the your data.

## Part 1 : Impact of different Learning Rate

   Explore different learning rate for batch gradient descent. 

## Part 2 : Impact of Regularization hyper-parameter

   Experiments with dierent /lmbda values.
 
## Part 3 : Impact of Normalization

 Training with non-normalized data Use the preprocessed data but skip the nor- malization.

## Results:



## Conclusion:
