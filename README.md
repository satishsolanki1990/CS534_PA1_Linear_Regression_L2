## Objective:

- To build a linear regression with L2 regularization that can be used to predict 
the houseâ€™s price based on a set of features.
- Develope insight on impact of Learning Rate and Regularization hyper-parameter 
  on model performance.

<summary> <b style="font-size:20px"> Data</b> </summary>
The dataset consisted of historic data on houses sold between May 2014 to 
May 2015.There are two data files:  __training (10000 examples) and devlopment (5597 examples)__ 

The dataset consisted of 23 features (including the dummy). 
The last one is the target for prediction. Variables Description Data Type
1. dummy [numeric]: 1
2. id [numeric]: a notation for a house 
3. date [string]: Date house was sold. __Splits into 3 categories: day of month,year, month__
4. bedrooms[numeric]: Number of Bedrooms/House
5. bathrooms[numeric]: Number of bathrooms/bedrooms 
6. sqft_living [numeric]: square footage of the home
7. sqft_lot [numeric]: square footage of the lot
8. floors [numeric]: Total floors (levels) in house
9. waterfront [numeric, Categorical]: House which has a view to a waterfront 
10. view [numeric]: Has been viewed 
11. condition [numeric, Categorical]: Overall condition 1 indicates worn out property and 5 excellent 
12. grade [numeric, Categorical]: Overall grade given to the housing unit. 1 poor ,13 excellent
13. sqft_above [numeric]: square footage of house apart from basement 
14. sqft_basement [numeric]: square footage of the basement 
15. yr_built [numeric] : Built Year
16. yr_renovated [numeric]: Year when house was renovated (0 if n/a)
17. zipcode [numeric]: zip 
18. lat Latitude [numeric] : coordinate 
19. long Longitude [numeric]: coordinate 
20. sqft_living15 [numeric]: Living room area in 2015 
21. sqft_lot15 [numeric]: lotSize area in 2015
22. price [numeric, continuous] : Price/100k, which is the __prediction target__

## Part 0 : Exploratory Data Analysis

Preprocessing and simple analysis. Perform the following preprocessing of the your data.

## Part 1 : Impact of different Learning Rate

   Explore different learning rate for batch gradient descent. 

## Part 2 : Impact of Regularization hyper-parameter

   Experiments with dierent /lmbda values.
 
## Part 3 : Impact of Normalization

 Training with non-normalized data Use the preprocessed data but skip the nor- malization.

## Results:



## Conclusion:
