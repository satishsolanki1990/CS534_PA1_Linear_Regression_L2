# Linear_Regression_L2
Linear Regression with L2 Regularization

# Part 0 (10 pts) : 
   # Preprocessing and simple analysis. Perform the following preprocessing of the your data.
# Part 1 (30 pts). 
  # Explore dierent learning rate for batch gradient descent. 

# Part2 (30 pts). Experiments with dierent /lmbda values.
 
# Part 3 (10 pts). 
  # Training with non-normalized data Use the preprocessed data but skip the nor- malization.
